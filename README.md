### Here's a bit of what I've worked on and am currently working on:

# [Aqua World Nepal](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/aqua-world-nepal/id1527237015)
This was my first solo project at InfoDevelopers. Aqua World Nepal is an e-commerce app designed for ordering water products online. The app provides users with options for online payment or cash on delivery, ensuring a convenient shopping experience.  

During this project, I gained hands-on experience with geolocation and map integration and integrating third-party payment SDKs. The app was built using UIKit and Storyboards, and I successfully published it on the App Store myself.
