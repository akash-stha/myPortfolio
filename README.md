# [Auth_SwiftUI](https://github.com/akash-stha/FirebaseAuth_SwiftUI)

I built an iOS app using SwiftUI that integrates Firebase Authentication for seamless user login, sign-up, and profile management. The app also utilizes Firestore to store and retrieve user data, offering a modern authentication experience. Currently, the app supports email/password authentication, with Google and Apple login (under development) features. To streamline navigation, I implemented a custom router for smooth transitions between views, making it easy to navigate to specific screens and return efficiently. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of testing.  

This project is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of testing. Through this app, I worked on implementing custom components, integrating Firebase services, and managing authentication flows effectively.  

### **Features**  
- **MVVM Architecture**: Organized code for separation of business logic and UI components.  
- **User Authentication**: Email/password sign-up, login, and logout functionality.  
- **Google Sign-In**: Integrates modern authentication options (under development).  
- **Firestore Integration**: Stores and retrieves user data for easy management.  
- **Profile Management**: Displays user profile details with options to delete the account or sign out.  
- **Custom Components & Utilities**: Built reusable views and helper functions, including a name formatter using `PersonNameComponentsFormatter`.
- **Custom Router**: Implemented a navigation system for seamless transitions between views and an efficient back-navigation mechanism.  

### **Project Highlights**  
- **Auth_SwiftUIApp.swift**: Configures Firebase and serves as the app's entry point.  
- **ContentView.swift**: Manages navigation between `LoginView` and `ProfileView` based on user session state.  
- **Views**:  
  - `LoginView.swift`: Login screen with options for email/password, Google, and Apple login.  
  - `CreateAccountView.swift`: Allows users to create new accounts.  
  - `ProfileView.swift`: Displays user profile information with options to sign out or delete the account.  
- **Reusable Components**: Includes `LogoView`, `GreetingTitleView`, `TextfieldView`, and more.  
- **ViewModel**:  
  - `AuthViewModel.swift`: Handles authentication logic and user session state.  
- **Utilities**: Includes helper functions for tasks like data validation, error handling, and formatting names.

# Hercules - OMS Logistics Dental Surgery Experts 
I collaborated with a team of developers to create a health application tailored for dental practitioners. This app was designed to facilitate the recording and management of patient information, with a focus on preoperative and intraoperative data.  

My role involved working extensively with API calls and API pushes, using tools like Postman to test and debug endpoints. I developed form-based functionality where user-entered data was sent to the backend through APIs, and the app's UI dynamically updated based on the new information fetched from the server. This ensured a seamless and responsive user experience for dental practitioners managing patient records.

I contributed to the development of online payment **Info mDabalai** and **Natural Smart Banking App** mobile applications for cooperatives and microfinance organizations. These apps offered various functionalities, including flight booking, recharge or top up service providers like Ncell, Namaste, QR payments, internet/water/electricity bill payments, fund transactions (send and receive), and remittance services.  

I implemented multiple third-party SDKs and managed dependencies using CocoaPods during this project. I also added push notifications, dark mode support, and localization to provide a multi-language experience for users. I worked on refactoring existing code and developed many new features from scratch, ensuring the apps were efficient and user-friendly. Additionally, I was responsible for publishing updates and bug fixes to the App Store.
