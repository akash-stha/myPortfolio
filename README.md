# [Auth_SwiftUI](https://github.com/akash-stha/FirebaseAuth_SwiftUI)

I built an iOS app using SwiftUI that integrates Firebase Authentication for seamless user login, sign-up, and profile management. The app also utilizes Firestore to store and retrieve user data, offering a modern authentication experience. Currently, the app supports email/password authentication, with Google and Apple login (under development) features. To streamline navigation, I implemented a custom router for smooth transitions between views, making it easy to navigate to specific screens and return efficiently. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of testing.  

This project is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of testing. Through this app, I worked on implementing custom components, integrating Firebase services, and managing authentication flows effectively.

- **Firestore Integration**: Stores and retrieves user data for easy management.  
- **Profile Management**: Displays user profile details with options to delete the account or sign out.  
- **Custom Components & Utilities**: Built reusable views and helper functions, including a name formatter using `PersonNameComponentsFormatter`.
- **Custom Router**: Implemented a navigation system for seamless transitions between views and an efficient back-navigation mechanism.  

### **Project Highlights**

# Hercules - OMS Logistics Dental Surgery Experts 
I collaborated with a team of developers to create a health application tailored for dental practitioners. This app was designed to facilitate the recording and management of patient information, with a focus on preoperative and intraoperative data.  

My role involved working extensively with API calls and API pushes, using tools like Postman to test and debug endpoints. I developed form-based functionality where user-entered data was sent to the backend through APIs, and the app's UI dynamically updated based on the new information fetched from the server. This ensured a seamless and responsive user experience for dental practitioners managing patient records.  

### **Technologies Used**
